# <a name="summary"></a> Summary
# Decarbonify site!


![Decarbonify](static/readme-doc/index.png)

For the Code Institute fourth Milestone Project, I decided to develop a site for an upcoming startup

dealing with a offering a market-place for reduction of carbon emission solutions. The company will 

have a CRM site to cover the Blog and about page of the site. This part of the site will mostly cover 

the backend part and saving of static and media files on PostgreSQL and AWS S3.


View the live project here. [Decarbonify](https://decarbonify-site.herokuapp.com/)

Kindly test the adding and deletion of solutions by adding own solution and DO NOT DELETE THE ITEMS ALREADY ON THE DATABASE.
To test the functionality, you can use below details for admin testing:

* Username: kay

* Password: Leyone2011

* Email: any

Payment simulation:

* Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242 (U.S.A.)

* Date: any date in the future

* CVC/ZIP: any integers

## User Experience (UX)


* **:bookmark_tabs: Strategy Plane**

The goal is to attract potential customers to use the market place and also allow potential users to sell their products 
and Decarbonify becomes the middle man offering some of the solutions, with the hope of future expansion to offer most of the products.

The target customer will be both B2C, B2G and B2B, because of the introduction of requirements for LCA rating to trade in Europe it has become a neccessity for organisations to be aware and fighting towards acquiring zero carbon emission in our environment.

It is important that the website allows the users to search for solutions and find detailed information about the solutions. A clear structure and a modern design is also nice but mostly functionality is most important. The CRM will handle most of the advertising through the blog and alert the users of the solutions. 

Because of the time span I did not include the Blog and About page. However it can be included as a potential expansion of the project. It was important to get details of users to allow smooth communication with users their needs.

A strong brand identity to match the CRM as the site will be connected to it, is necessary and the shopping process needs to be functional and interactive.


* **:bookmark_tabs: Scope Plane**

For better interactivity the website needs to be mobile first designed and responsive to all devices.


* **:bookmark_tabs: Structure Plane**

The system should allow the user to register in order to save personal details and review their order history and edit profile details.

The possibility to complete an order without registering is available in the site especially for not complicated solutions like LCA results, or for those customers who want only a one-time solution purchase
 or simply don't want to have a personal profile on the website.

The system must allow users to search the database by entering specific words in a search box, or by just navigating the website sort list eg price, or by the given list types or just rather redirect them to the main solution categories. 

The user needs to constantly monitor the shopping wishlist status without entering the shopping bag page therefore allowing them to track their spending.

Admins can be able to access the dashboard by logging in with admin password and add products or edit them. A normal user will not be able to do such. A logged in user can also see profile history.

**Interaction design:**
* A user friendly interface to ensure usability and to encourage the user to return.
* Responsive and visible links which change on hover to provide user feedback as they navigate the site.
* Ability to pop up alerts so a user is alerted of what steps they are doing.

* **:bookmark_tabs: Information Architecture:**

* Navigation bar at the top of the page
* Responsive navigation bar - adjusting for mobile for ease of use
* Responsive images to ensure they fit within the designated spaces, no matter what device is being used or the size of the screen
* All features appropriate size and responsive for mobile and desktop viewing
* All information is appropriate and relative to the subject and not misleading or hard to find

### Design

### Colour Scheme

The colors of the site had to match [Decarbonify site](https://decarbonify.com/) theme and the owners required a softer green color with white to show cleanness.

- # Colour scheme
  The colours that are used for the start and game over screen are:
- ![#fffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fffff/000000?text=+) #ffffff (White)
- ![#28a745](https://via.placeholder.com/15/28a745/000000?text=+) #28a745 (Green)
- ![#36621b](https://via.placeholder.com/15/36621b/000000?text=+) #36621b] (Dark green)
- ![#ff4500](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff4500/000000?text=+) #ff4500 (dark orange)


### Typography

I choosed two fonts that are modern and highly legible: 

* Montserrat
* Sans Serif


### Imagery

Some images were used in the website and resized using [tinypng site](https://tinypng.com/) and all of them have a common 

background gradient of green or white colours, as a base colour and gives a different tone to the body.

I selected the products that I thought would fit well with the goals of this site.

The market image is from decarbonify and showing a sample of their market place that is still under development.



* **:computer: Skeleton Plan:**

The structure of the website is:

* Home Page

* Solutions by Category, price, rating

* Product Details

* About -Team, Mission, Vision, Location map (For future expansion proposal)

* Register

* Login

* My Profile (personal details, Purchase history)

* Wishlist or shopping basket 

* Checkout page

* Checkout Confirm page

* Manage product page (admin)

## Testing


<summary>Functionality Testing </summary>

### Functionality Testing

All the <strong>links</strong> are working.

The <strong>form</strong> validation is handled by Django and it is working.

<strong>HTML</strong> has been validated with [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and everything was ok.

<strong>CSS</strong> has been validated with [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). 

<strong>JavaScript</strong> has been checked with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

For <strong>Python</strong> I used the command ```python3 -m flake8``` in my terminal to highlight all the issues in my project.
Most of the errors were too long lines and errors DJ01 ("Avoid using null=True on string-based fields").

left the ones below because they are important for the functionality:


<details>

```
./checkout/webhooks.py:28:5: F841 local variable 'e' is assigned to but never used
./checkout/webhooks.py:31:5: F841 local variable 'e' is assigned to but never used
./checkout/apps.py:8:9: F401 'checkout.signals' imported but unused
```


</details>

I successfully tested also payments using different credit cards provided by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#international-cards).

I checked that the payment form adapts to the credit card number:


<details>

If I enter a card that is in the U.S.A., I get the field for the ZIP code.
    
    Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Date: any date in the future | CVC: any number | ZIP Code(example): 24242

If I enter a card that is in the U.K., I get the field for the postal code.
    
    Card Number: 4000 0082 6000 0000 | Date: any date in the future | CVC: any number | Postal Code(example): SW1W 0NY

If I enter a card that is in Australia, I don't get any additional field apart from the credit card details.
    
    Card Number: 4000 0003 6000 0006 | Date: any date in the future | CVC: any number 

I tested the authorization for the payment:

    Card number: 4000 0027 6000 3184

I tested for a invalid CVC:
     
    Card number: 4000 0000 0000 0101

I tested for insufficient founds;

    Card number: 4000 0000 0000 9995

I tested for stolen card:

    Card number: 4000 0000 0000 9979

I tested for expired card:

    Card number: 4000 0000 0000 0069


</details>

### :star: Acknowledgements

Thank you to my mentor Akshat Garg for his help.

A special thanks also to the Code Institute Tutor Team, that has been always very nice helping with some issues that I faced
 during the development and when my transfer of files from Django to S3 failed for days. A big thanks to all for their patience and courtesy.

Thank you also to all that took the time to test the website.

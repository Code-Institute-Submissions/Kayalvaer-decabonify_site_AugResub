# Decarbonify site!


![Decarbonify](static/readme-doc/index.png)

For the Code Institute fourth Milestone Project, I decided to develop a site for an upcoming startup

dealing with a offering a market-place for reduction of carbon emission solutions. The company will 

have a CRM site to cover the Blog and about page of the site. This part of the site will mostly cover 

the backend part and saving of static and media files on PostgreSQL and AWS S3.
